## Installing dependencies
The gulp tasks for this project require gulp v4-alpha ([docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0/docs)). If you already have gulp v3.x installed globally, it must be removed to make way for v4.
```bash
npm uninstall -g gulp
```
Next, install the gulp v4 `gulp-cli` globally.
```bash
npm install -g gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0
```
Finally, run the following command from the project's root directory to install the dependencies defined in package.json.
```bash
npm install
```
